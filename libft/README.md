## LIBFT PROJECT
### The project consists of imitate several libc functions.
#### This was my first 42Madrid project.

<div style="text-align:justify">In this project, I learned the behaviour of the main libc functions, 
this knowledge gave me a great understanding of how C works. In addition, also it helped me to manage without problems
with C memory logistics.</div>

### The most difficult function (or from which I learned the most)

<div style="text-align:justify">Such as I said, one of the things that I improved with this project is the memory control, 
one example of the functions that make me to improve was ft_split. This function receives a str string (char *) and a c char. 
What the function must do is split str being c the delimiter of each string.</div>
